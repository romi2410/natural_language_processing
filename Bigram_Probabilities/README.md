To run the program: Navigate to the path where python program is downloaded and type ‘python ./bigram.py’ to run the code. 

Output: Following four files will be generated on running the program –

1.	bigramNoSmoothing.txt – will contain bigrams, bigram counts and bigram probabilities for bigram model with no smoothing.

2.	bigramAddOneSmoothing.txt - will contain bigrams, bigram counts and bigram probabilities for bigram model with Add-one (or Laplace) smoothing.

3.	bigramGoodTuringDiscounting.txt - will contain bigrams, bigram counts and bigram probabilities for bigram model with Good-turing discounting based smoothing.

4.	unigramCounts.txt - will contain unigrams and unigram counts of the entire corpus.
