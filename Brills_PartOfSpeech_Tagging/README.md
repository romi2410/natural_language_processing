Transformational-Based Tagging - Brill's algorithm - Label every word with
its most-likely tag. Examine every possible transformation, and select the
one that results in the most improved tagging. Re-tag the data according
to this rule.

To run the program: Navigate to the path where python program is downloaded and type ‘python ./brillsTagging.py’ to run the code. 

Output: Following three files will be generated on running the program –
1.	brillsTransformationRulesNNToVB.txt – will contain best five transformation rules to transform “NN” to “VB”.

2.	brillsTransformationRulesVBToNN.txt – will contain best five transformation rules to transform “VB” to “NN”.

3.	mostLikelyTags.txt – will contain list of every word and its tag from the tagged corpus and its most likely tag.
